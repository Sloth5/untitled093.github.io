<h4>
Bi- being attracted to more than 1 gender,, but a lot of people have different ideas of what being bi is to them, so this isn’t a concrete definition

Incorrect stereotypes:
Bi men are just gay with internalized homophobia- 1.8% of adults identify as bi, so don’t ever talk to me or my 13,500,000 friends again
Bi girls are just straight and lying- kinda odd that both of these stereotypes are centered around everyone being attracted to men, huh?
Bi people are cheaters- your sexuality doesn’t define if you’re a bad person or not
Bi people don’t belong in the lgbtq+ community because they’re half straight- you still like boys and girls, and the lgbtq+ community is for people who don’t fit into the “normal” idea of sexuality
Bi people like every gender equally- nope, sexuality is a spectrum and preferences vary on the person
Bi people only like cis people- example: trans men are men, and bi people like men, so no???
Just indecisive- no, people who like multiple genders at the same time exist

  <span class="multicolortext"> PANSEXUAL PALS!</span>


Pan- attracted to all genders without noticing gender

Incorrect stereotypes-

Pan people are just bi- no, don’t invalidate pan people, and bi people might not like all genders

”Man, you’re so desperate you’ll date anyone, huh?”- can we not invalidate pan people k thx

Pan people are biphobic- no, as a bi person, I can confirm that pan people are pretty chill
